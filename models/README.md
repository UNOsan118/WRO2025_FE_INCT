# 3D Models and Engineering Files

This directory contains all engineering files for our robot's mechanical design.

## Directory Structure

*   [`custom_parts/`](./custom_parts/): CAD files (`.SLDPRT`) and blueprints (`.pdf`) for parts we designed.
*   [`commercial_parts/`](./commercial_parts/): CAD models of off-the-shelf components.
*   [`assemblies/`](./assemblies/): The complete robot assembly model and diagrams.
